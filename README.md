> This tool doesn't work yet!

Analyzer for the [Z3 theorem prover](https://github.com/z3prover/z3) that sits between z3 and a user of z3. This is especially useful for tools that interact with z3 over an extended period of time.

This tool draws heavy inspiration from [Axiom Profiler](https://github.com/viperproject/axiom-profiler)
